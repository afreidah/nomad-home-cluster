This setup leverages Nomad and Consul for orchestration and service discovery, with Traefik handling external routing. All services are deployed behind OpenVPN, and Pi-hole/Unbound provide DNS resolution. A Docker Registry and its UI manage container images, and a Deluge Torrent server handles torrents. All services are registered with Consul and exposed through Traefik, leveraging the power of Nomad's flexible scheduler for easy deployment and management. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Core Components:
Nomad (3 Nodes): Nomad is the workload scheduler, responsible for deploying and managing all services within the cluster. 
Consul (3 Nodes): Consul serves as the service discovery and configuration repository. 
Traefik: Traefik acts as a dynamic reverse proxy and load balancer, routing traffic to the appropriate services registered with Consul. 
Deployed Services (Behind OpenVPN):
Pi-hole + Unbound: Provides DNS resolution and ad-blocking, potentially improving browsing experience. 
Docker Registry: Stores container images for efficient deployment. 
Docker Registry UI: Provides a web interface to manage Docker Registry. 
OpenVPN: Encrypts all communication within the network, enhancing security. 
Deluge Torrent Server: Manages torrent downloads. 
Other Services: Any additional services you want to run can be added here, all registered with Consul and exposed by Traefik. 
Network Architecture:
1. External Traffic:
External clients access services through a single Traefik entry point, which uses Consul to discover and route traffic to the appropriate backend services. 
2. Consul Service Discovery:
Services register with Consul, providing information about their availability and address. 
3. Nomad Orchestration:
Nomad deploys and manages all services, ensuring they are running and healthy. 
4. OpenVPN Security:
All internal communication within the cluster (including between Nomad, Consul, and services) is protected by OpenVPN. 
Benefits of this Architecture:
Scalability:
Nomad and Consul can manage a large number of services across multiple nodes. 
Reliability:
Services can be automatically restarted if they fail, ensuring high availability. 
Flexibility:
Nomad can deploy any workload, from containerized applications to non-containerized services. 
Security:
OpenVPN provides a secure, encrypted network for internal communication. 
Simplified Management:
Consul, Nomad, and Traefik provide a unified platform for managing your infrastructure. 
This architecture provides a robust and flexible foundation for deploying a variety of services, all managed and secured by Nomad, Consul, and Traefik, with added features like Pi-hole/Unbound and OpenVPN for a complete solution.
